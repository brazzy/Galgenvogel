**Work in Progress**

A minimalist Roguelike game using the [24a2](https://github.com/jamesroutley/24a2) framework.

Design goals: 

* no text, communicate game state exclusively through the grid of colored dots.
* easily understandable basic gameplay
* increasing difficulty to provide a challenge
* subtleties and maybe secrets that are rewarding to discover
